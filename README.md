## About Organ Donation
Today, in Ontario, there are over 1,500 people waiting for a 
lifesaving organ transplant. This is their only treatment option, 
and every 3 days someone will die because they did not get their 
transplant in time.

But you can help. When you register your consent for organ and 
tissue donation, you let those waiting know that you would
help them if you could.

## What should we know

We are actively involved in raising awareness and education for organ and tissue donation and transplantation. We maintain a national transplant registry for inter-provincial organ sharing and related programs and we help save and improve lives by working closely with the organ and tissue donation and transplantation communities.
