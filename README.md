## About Organ Donation
Today, in Ontario, there are over 1,500 people waiting for a 
lifesaving organ transplant. This is their only treatment option, 
and every 3 days someone will die because they did not get their 
transplant in time.

But you can help. When you register your consent for organ and 
tissue donation, you let those waiting know that you would
help them if you could.

## What should we know

* The thinly populated Canadian Shield in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario.

* The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested.

* Southern Ontario which is further sub-divided into four regions.
